        <p>What is a Variable?</p>
        <p>A Variable is a placeholder for a single, short piece of content like a word, phrase, product name, phone number, or trademark that is used over and over in your project. Instead of reentering the same information multiple times, you can create a variable and Flare will insert the proper information in the output. Variables are made up of two parts: the variable name and the variable definition.</p>
        <p>A good example of using a variable is as follows.</p>
        <p>KLR Corporation sells a wonderful supersized dust buster called the Smart Bunny. Instead of typing Smart Bunny into the text every time you refer to the product, you can create a variable with the variable name “ProductName” and the variable definition “Smart Bunny”. Insert the “ProductName” variable into your text and “Smart Bunny” will appear in the output.</p>
        <p>Types of Variables</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Custom Basic Variables – can be used for any purpose.</li>
            <li>Custom Date/Time Variables</li>
            <li>System Variables</li>
            <li>Heading Variables</li>
            <li>Running Head Variables</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Multiple Definitions</p>
        <p>You can also associate multiple definitions with the same variable. This is particularly useful when publishing manuals for different areas of the country or different countries. See example below.</p>
        <p>KLR Corporation has customer service centers in all 50 states.  Service Center contact information is on the last page of the how-to manual which comes with each Smart Bunny; the contact phone number will differ depending on which state the product was shipped to, but the text surrounding each number is the same:</p>
        <p>In you need assistance at any time in operating your Smart Bunny or have any other questions, please phone (insert variable name “CompanyPhone” here). </p>
        <p>The phone number for each state is the variable definition.</p>
