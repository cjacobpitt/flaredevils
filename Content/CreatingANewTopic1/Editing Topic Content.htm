        <p>Editing Topic Content</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>One of the premier features of Flare is the ability to import content from any number of programs, such as MS Word, Adobe Framemaker, Adobe RoboHelp, HTML, XHTML and others. The user thus avoids the repetitious and time wasting task of re-entering information that already exists elsewhere. </p>
        <p>Once the content is in Flare, the text is converted to XML. Flare source is all XML – no matter what the original content. Going forward, the content is edited solely in Flare – either using the Text Editor or the XML Editor or both simultaneously. </p>
        <p>Structure bars aid this process by revealing the underlying block structure of the XML.</p>
        <p>What is XML?</p>
        <p>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language.</p>
        <p>XML is a language used to write documents to store and transport data over the web. It has self-describing syntax meaning that it can be read and understood by computers but also by the average user.&#160; It is written in plain text rather than a standardized language that contains abbreviations and symbols known only to experienced users such as HTML. Unlike HTML, it does not contain any information on the display or presentation of the data, only the data itself. As a result, data stored using XML can be presented in many different programs or forms.</p>
