            <h1>What Is A Topic?
        </h1>
            <p>The term <b>Topic</b> refers to any chunk of information that is contained within your Flare manual. Much like chapters or modules, topics are used to separate content into digestible and easily organized sections. Topics are the main content of any manual, and Flare makes every effort to make topics easy to navigate and edit.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Navigating Topics</h3>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>All topics can be found in the <b>Content Explorer</b>, which is the sidebar on the left part of the screen. That sidebar contain both the <b>Content Explorer</b> and the <b>Project Organizer</b>. If the sidebar is set to show the <b>Project Explorer</b>, click on the button that says <b>Content Explorer</b> located at the bottom of the sidebar.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Inside the <b>Content Explorer</b> is a series of folders. If you are using a template provided by Flare, then there will be multiple folders for different topic types. At the moment, these are placeholder files with no text. Each topic will be in the <b>.htm</b> format, to allow it to be formatted for web and print. Topics will almost always be edited by the user, but there are some cases where Flare can generate content for a topic, such as when creating a table of contents, glossary, or index.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Fill Up: Content is edited within either the <b>Text Editor</b> or the <b>XML Editor</b>. The <b>Text Editor</b> is designed to be more like InDesign or Microsoft Word, with a focus on how the finished product will look. The XML Editor is focused more on the organization of the writing itself, containing the styles and text tags that will show up in the web version.</p>
