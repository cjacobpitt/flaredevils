       ]]></h1>
            <p>MadCap Flare offers support for all kinds of styling over a variety of outputs. This means that any styling you use for a PDF guide can be easily translated into an HTML guide. The way this is done is by having styles be formatted as CSS (or Cascading Style Sheets). As a result of this, working with styles is a bit more involved than it would be if you were working with InDesign or Microsoft Word.</p>
